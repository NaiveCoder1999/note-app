The goal of this project is to implement an application called `note-app` to manage notes taking. For it, we will implement a back-end [Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/) application called `springboot-note` to provice REST APIs for resource access and a font-end [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) application called `note-react-app` to provide browser access. Besides, we will use  [OAuth 2.0](https://www.oauth.com/) and [JWT Authentication](https://jwt.io/introduction) supported by [Spring Authorization Server]( https://docs.spring.io/spring-authorization-server/docs/current/reference/html/overview.html) secure both applications.

## Get Started

- Online Service

  - **Check the** üåê **[LIVE DEMO on AWS ECS ](http://note-loadb-1153hxl66luz-dfb9d722b8f996bd.elb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)** (Please make sure Port 8080 and 8090 is not blocked on your network). The **username** and **password** are `guest`
  - The other users/passwords are:`coder` and `nocoder`.

- Local Service

  - Make sure Docker is installed, then in a terminal, make sure you are inside `note-app` root folder. Run the following command to start docker compose containers:

    ```shell
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    
    Then access http://127.0.0.1/ in browser
  - To stop and remove docker-compose containers and network, in the terminal and inside `note-app` folder, run the command below
  
    ```shell
    docker compose down -v
    ```

- CI/CD pipeline status
  - The `note-app-update-pipeline` can be viewed on http://172.96.205.185:8080/
